# RAML Console Prototype for v3

This branch only contains the prototype components for the new version of the API Console v3. Version 3 will combine reusable web components that have been developed in cooperation with the [Advanced Rest Client](https://advancedrestclient.com/) team. The full prototype for the ARC project can be accessed [here](https://github.com/jarrodek/arc-prototype/) and we would be happy if anyone has feedback for the very good work these guys do.

The purpose of this branch is to give you an idea on what we are working on and to give you a chance to give us feedback very early in the process.

More information you can find [here]() and on the same issue you are invited to give us your feedback.
